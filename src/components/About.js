        <p>I’ve spent the past 4+ years working across different areas of front-end development with specialization in javascript development. These days my time is spent bringing web designs to life, maintain the website's user interface, implement responsive design. Throughout my career, I have shown and proven my adaptability, my ability to learn quickly, and my resilience. </p>
